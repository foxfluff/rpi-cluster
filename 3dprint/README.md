**Case.stl:** Start by attaching the panel mount ethernet extension to the back
of the case as shown below.  After this, slide the POE switch in to place using
the provided hooks and slide each RPi in to their given slot.  Once everything
is in place you can connect all your ethernet cables and route as necessary to
give it a clean look.
